Predicting Credit Card Defaults with Machine Learning
Project Description

This project investigates the prediction of credit card defaults using machine learning methods.

Dataset: UCI Credit Card Default dataset (Yeh & Lien, 2009).

Goals:

Explore dataset characteristics (EDA, visualization).

Compare several supervised learning models (Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Trees, Random Forest, kNN, Na√Øve Bayes).

Evaluate performance with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

Discuss limitations and future work in credit risk modelling.

The main purpose is to highlight the effectiveness of different machine learning algorithms for financial risk prediction, with a focus on handling class imbalance and interpretability.
